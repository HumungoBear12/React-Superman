              The Justice League, a team of superheroes, debuted in "The Brave and the Bold" #28 in 1960, created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky. The founding members included Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter. Over the years, the roster expanded to include various DC Comics characters.

            In the 1980s, the Justice League underwent a significant transformation with the series "Justice League International," focusing on a more comedic and international team dynamic. The 1990s saw the formation of "Justice League America" and "Justice League Europe." The animated series in the early 2000s, particularly "Justice League" and "Justice League Unlimited," gained widespread popularity, introducing the team to a broader audience.

            The mid-2000s marked a comic reboot with "Justice League of America," featuring a core lineup including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), and Aquaman. The New 52 initiative in 2011 brought a revised origin for the team, attracting both praise and criticism.

            The cinematic universe expanded the Justice League's reach with the release of "Man of Steel" (2013), "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (2016), and "Wonder Woman" (2017). The culmination occurred in 2017 with the release of "Justice League," directed by Zack Snyder.

            However, internal issues and mixed critical reception led to a prolonged campaign by fans for a "Snyder Cut." In 2021, Warner Bros. released "Zack Snyder's Justice League," an extended and reimagined version of the film.

            In the comic realm, subsequent story arcs explored new challenges and threats, with characters like Cyborg, Shazam, and others joining the team. In recent years, the Justice League has undergone various iterations, adapting to the evolving landscape of DC Comics, exploring diverse themes, and introducing fresh characters.

            As of the present day, the Justice League continues to be a central fixture in DC Comics, embodying the spirit of collaboration and heroism against formidable adversaries, both on the page and on screen. The team's legacy endures through its rich history and ongoing contributions to the superhero genre.</p>
